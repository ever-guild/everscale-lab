## Update branch from main

> A tidy, linear Git history  https://www.bitsnbites.eu/a-tidy-linear-git-history/

Get the latest upstream changes and update the working branch:

```shell
git fetch --prune origin
git rebase --autostash --ignore-date origin/main
```

During the rebase, there may be conflicts, they need to be resolved and after the decision to continue the rebase:

```shell
git rebase --continue
```

Upload the updated working branch to the repository, given that we changed the history, this should be done with the force option:

```shell
git push --force --set-upstream origin feature/name-of-feature
```

More details can be found in the tutorial: [git rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase).
